# VhostFinder
This tool will identify virtual hosts by performing a similarity comparison. It will generate a baseline request to attempt to map a non-existent virtual host. From there it will iterate over the supplied domains and compare them for any differences. Any significant differences will result in a virtual host being detected.

Please note that while this tool supports directory enumeration, there are better tools available to perform directory fuzzing once a vhost is identified.

A valid vhost record can be added to your `/etc/hosts` file or inserted into a DNS server to be used with other tools.

# What is Virtual Host Fuzzing?

Essentially the following request is sent repeatedly to a particular IP:

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: FUZZ
Connection: close


```

The host header is fuzzed based on user input, while all requests are sent to the same IP.
